bugfixes:
  - Update the unit tests to be compatible with ansible-core 2.19
minor_changes:
  - plugins/action/api - Mark the template field as a trusted template source. This was the default behaviour of ansible-core until 2.19
  - plugins/modules/change_request_task - Throw an error if state=='pending' and on_hold=True, like the documentation says
